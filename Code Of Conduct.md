Code of Conduct – Biological Spoofing System (BSS)

👋 Welcome

Thank you for contributing to the Biological Spoofing System (BSS) project by Alien Algorithms Ltd®. This Code of Conduct exists to ensure that this space remains productive, respectful, and aligned with our mission: to advance human health and security through open, ethical innovation.

🌐 Our Standards

We commit to a respectful, inclusive, and collaborative environment. Contributors are expected to:

Treat others with kindness and intellectual honesty

Engage in good-faith scientific and technical discussions

Provide criticism constructively and receive feedback openly

Credit others for their work and respect attribution guidelines

We do not tolerate:

Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks of any kind

Dismissive or hostile language toward mental health or disability

Unethical research practices or manipulation of scientific data

🧬 Ethical Alignment

Because this project involves biosignal modeling, pathogen deterrence, and cognitive frameworks, we require that contributors:

Avoid advocating or contributing content intended for military, surveillance, eugenics, or bioweapon purposes

Respect all international ethical research standards (e.g. UNESCO bioethics, BWC treaty principles)

Disclose any potential misuse or ethical concerns they identify

🤝 Enforcement

Maintainers of this project have the right and responsibility to:

Remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, or pull requests that violate this Code of Conduct

Temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behaviors deemed inappropriate or harmful

Reports of unacceptable behavior may be submitted via GitHub's private advisory system or through project discussion channels.

🙌 Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant v2.1 and modified to reflect the ethical requirements of biological and psychological systems research.

Thank you for helping us build something bigger than software. Your conduct defines the integrity of this project and the future we’re trying to shape.
