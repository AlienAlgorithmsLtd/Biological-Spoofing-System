# Security Policy for Biological Spoofing System (BSS)

## 🔐 Overview

The **Biological Spoofing System (BSS)** developed by **Alien Algorithms Ltd®** is a security-sensitive bioengineering project. It is designed for passive antiviral deterrence and must not be used, repurposed, or modified in any way that poses a threat to biological, environmental, or national security.

This document outlines how we handle vulnerability disclosures, misuse prevention, and biosecurity oversight.
